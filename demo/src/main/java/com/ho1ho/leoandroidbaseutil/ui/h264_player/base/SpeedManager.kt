/**
 * Movie player callback.
 *
 * The goal here is to play back frames at the original rate.  This is done by introducing
 * a pause before the frame is submitted to the renderer.
 *
 * This is not coordinated with VSYNC.  Since we can't control the display's refresh rate, and
 * the source material has time stamps that specify when each frame should be presented,
 * we will have to drop or repeat frames occasionally.
 *
 * Thread restrictions are noted in the method descriptions.  The FrameCallback overrides should
 * only be called from the MoviePlayer.
